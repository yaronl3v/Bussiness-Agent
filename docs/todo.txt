[test this should be done]
2. ** todo: add to config tab, a switch "allow questions before gathering info." 
this allows agent to asnwer user questions  before user answered all questions if provided.
we need to 1. add this data to agent, if json then update, if not then need migration and add column
2. add UI on front end
3. add small section in prompt to explain this and pass current value per config so bot understand the behavour (via prompt)

Need to make an upgrade.

Right now user can set leads and dynamic schema then bot collects data in this order then give the post colection information.
But what if user wants dynamic info then give post collection then do the lead schema collection? so we need a dnyamic flow.

1. To config tab front end, lets add a component that allow user to pick the order of sections
 [DYNAMIC_INFO_SCHEMA_STATE, POST_COLLECTION_INFORMATION, LEAD_SCHEMA_STATE]
 user can simply drag up or down each item (give each a nice humnan understabnle name for users, same as you use in UI -> need to change
 the naming in UI as well for section, so they are more clear for users and just better.

2. As as far as bot we control this behaviour by adjusting prompt and sending variables to bot. 
We can control this by adjusting the <Chat Flow> section, and maybe adjsuting what we say about each part.
Goal is in each section just describe what it is not when it should performed, the chat flow controls the order.

We give it the order of the sections and we adjust fix pormpt to make it clear what is each section, and the order of steps (we insert dynamicly)
bot should do, we explain it clearly in prompt (make these adjusmt to single_prompt.txt)

3. Need to enhance bot response protocol and processing, such that bot can report which parts are done.
i.e done collecting lead info, done collecting dyamic info etc per what we need. Why? so when we get we can save data 
in our db.

So when this is done, user on front end can reorder and bot operate accordginly.
Specifically bot can now do -> dynamic info, send post collectoin then lead state, or any other order.

[test]Invites should be done

[invites] with roles. read.

[]Integrate whatsup + with whatsup onboarding
** [later]need to complete conversation (have demo data to remove)
right now conversations i guess is showing some demo data, instead it should show the actual data belonging to this agent.
[]Fix UI a bit.
