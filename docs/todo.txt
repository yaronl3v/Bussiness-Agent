Right now it used just for ui in front end, in the beinging of chat. Lets make some changes
1. Lets replace its name to intro info. 
2. Our funnel is such that first user interacts with bot then bot answers. so no need for auto msg on start.
3. Instead the intro, is added to the agnet prompt, this tells the agent a bit about itself.
Example, user may fill in "You are a landscape advisor names Uri". Then agent can use this info, when presenting itself however it see fit.
